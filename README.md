# global-transactions
This workspace stores my comprehensive knowledge &amp;  practice by using Python for statistical analysis and modeling. The dataset covers the global transactions of 4233 products.
It helps to showcase my skills via:

**(1)** **Technical tools:** Use both Python & SQL (embed) from making ETL process to deploying machine learning

**(2) Analytic skill:** Analyze to provide actionable insights and strategies for full cases (Portfolio, Product Funnel, Customer behavior, etc)

The work follows the ETL process: data is extracted from sources, transformed through cleaning and analysis, and then loaded into reporting systems for accessibility, with findings attached.

üõ†Ô∏è  **Extract & Cleaning**

- Data Import & Inspection: Import the dataset using required libraries and examine data structure
- Data Standardization: Convert key columns (`InvoiceDate`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceNo`) to appropriate data types for consistency
- Null & Abnormal Value Handling: Apply imputation techniques and filter incomplete records to ensure clean and reliable data.

ü§ñ  **Model & Machine Learning Deployment**

**1.  Unsupervised Learning:**

- Classification: RFM analysis, K-Mean Clustering, Indexing (Value/Churn index)
- Recommender: Association rule mining (Basket analysis)

**2.  Supervised Learning:**

- Prediction (Linear Regression): Forecasted sales trends and customer purchase frequency

**3.  Evaluation & Optimization:**

- Standardize:  StandardScaler, Elbow technique
- Fitting: RMSE, confusion matrices

üí°  **Load & Insights**

- Generate actionable insights by analyzing customer purchasing patterns and segment performance
- Propose growth strategies based on revenue trends and retention analysis
- Cover top-to-down analysis level across business & customer pain points
